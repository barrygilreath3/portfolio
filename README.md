# Portfolio

## Task

In this assignment, I was tasked to build a portfolio page from scratch.

This website is designed to showcase a developer's bio, skills, talents, and portfolio to potential employers.

This website was constructed using HTML & CSS.

## User Story & Acceptance Criteria
I was given the following user story:

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

Here are the critical requirements for acceptance:

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
## Work-in-Progress
First Commit: 3/22/2022
Second Commit: 4/8/2022

This portfolio will be updated as I add my own projects.  The first commit of this project (3/22/2022) included sample projects which will be replaced with projects I actually built.

The second commit includes updated links to projects I have contributed to or built myself.
